# Why am I blogging?
This is the first installment in a series of blog posts I’m writing for you! - so long as you are University of Texas student interested in taking Glen Downing’s Software engineering course. Many times we students take courses for any of three reasons:
* To satisfy a degree requirement 
* We have a career or academic interest in the learning outcomes of the course 
* Or simply because the course description is really cool and we need to maintain a certain number of hours each semester. 
Each person has their own way of choosing courses, but one thing every student searches for before deciding their registration is student recommendations. We want to know what the professor is like, what the work load is like, and whether the course is going to be beneficial to our education – which looks different for each person. I’ll be posting blogs weekly on a variety of topics that are meant to convey the experience I am having in the course to you. I hope my blog can help you decide whether this course is worth your time.

## This week I’ll be answering the following

### What did you do this past week?
  Classes started! This week we were introduced to the development framework and materials we will be using for the course. I have a lot of software to become familiar with, which excites me since I have never had software engineering work experience. I'm particularly excited to learn how to use unittest, coverage, and Travis CI together (which helps to automate testing in Python).
  
### What's in your way?
  I have another class immediately before software engineering at 11:00 AM in the UTC that gets out at 10:50 AM in the Music building. If you know these two buildings, then you know that it’s a 15 minute walk from one to the other. The problem here is that it looks like I’m going to be late to class every day until something changes. Did you know that daily quizzes start at the beginning of class and end when I show up?
  
### What will you do next week?
  I plan on using a bicycle to see if I can improve my travel time enough to make it to class on time. If that does not work, I will ask the professor of my early class if I can leave 5 minutes early. If the problem is not solvable by Friday, I will consider changing my class schedule.

## Tip of the week
Take the location of your classes into consideration! A quick navigation search on Google Maps would show you that you might not be able to get to class on time.
