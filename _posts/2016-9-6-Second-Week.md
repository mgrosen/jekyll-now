#August 29 - September 4
* What did you do this past week?
    - This past week I started reading the textbooks. Both Javascript: the Good Parts and Extreme Programming: Installed have been
    very enjoyable and straight forward books to read - something I actually encourage you as a developer to read whether or not 
    you decide to take the course. I also started setting up the Github repositories for this class. I was already familiar with
    git and Github, but some excellent resources and instructions are provided so that you would be able to git going quickly if
    you have not had the opportunity to work with Github before.
* What's in your way?
    - This week I am happy to report that nothing has slowed me down to much yet, but I have not been very proactive about getting
    a development environment set up on my laptop. Of course these projects can be done in the lab, but I have a part-time job 
    for three hours everyday afterschool where I could do some coding.
* What will you do next week?
   - Following that up, this next week I will set up Docker on my machine so that I can have all the tools necessary to develop
    when I have the chance at work. Also, I intend to finish project one. 
    
I'm really excited about an optimization that I thought of when my roommate and I, who are both studying Computer Science and both 
named Matthew, were talking about an algorithm used to solve an entirely different problem. It's times like this where I realize 
how important it is to be around other computer scientists, students, and developers - often simply talking through the problem 
with someone can lead you to a better solution.
